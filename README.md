# A Deep Dive (Into Confusion): The Movie & Series Labyrinth (2024-2025)
## Navigating the Digital Maze (Database Structure - Proceed with Caution!)

Here's a glimpse into the tables you'll find. Be warned, the relationships might be more tangled than a plot twist in a Christopher Nolan film:

* **movies:** Core information about movies, including title, release date, genre(s), director(s), etc.
* **series:** Similar to `movies`, but for television series, including title, start and end dates (if applicable), genre(s), creator(s), etc.
* **actors:** A list of actors and their basic information.
* **actresses:** (Yes, I might have initially separated them. It seemed like a good idea at the time... maybe.) A list of actresses and their basic information. *(Consider merging these into a single `people` table with a `role` or `gender` column for better organization in the future! Just a thought from someone who's been lost in here for a while.)*
* **directors:** Information about the directors of the movies.
* **creators:** Information about the creators of the series.
* **imdb_ratings:** IMDb ratings and potentially other details for both movies and series (linked appropriately).
* **genres:** A table of different genres to avoid redundancy in the `movies` and `series` tables.
* **movie_actors:** A linking table to establish the many-to-many relationship between movies and actors.
* **series_actors:** A linking table for the many-to-many relationship between series and actors.
* **movie_genres:** A linking table for the many-to-many relationship between movies and genres.
* **series_genres:** A linking table for the many-to-many relationship between series and genres.
* **(And potentially many more... I honestly can't recall them all right now.)**

**Key Relationships (Good Luck Following These):**

* One movie can have multiple actors (via `movie_actors`).
* One actor can be in multiple movies (via `movie_actors`).
* Similar relationships exist for series and actors (`series_actors`), and for movies/series and genres (`movie_genres`, `series_genres`).
* Movies and series likely have foreign key relationships to `imdb_ratings`, `directors`/`creators`, and `genres`.

**Note:** The exact schema and constraints might require a bit of exploration on your part. Consider it an adventure!

## Getting Started (If You Dare)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MachFrum/chaosDB/commits?author=MachFrum
    ```
2.  **Examine the SQL files:** Look for `.sql` files that contain the table definitions and potentially initial data.
3.  **Set up your own database:** Use a SQL client (like DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.) to create a new database.
4.  **Execute the SQL scripts:** Run the SQL files to create the tables and populate them (if data is included).
5.  **Start exploring!** Feel free to write your own queries. Just don't blame me if you end up questioning the very fabric of your digital existence.

## Updates and the Ever-Expanding Universe

This database is a living (and occasionally mutating) entity. I intend to update it with new releases and potentially refine the schema as I (or someone braver than I) gains a clearer understanding of its intricacies. Expect more tables, more relationships, and potentially more existential database crises in the future.

## Contributing (Enter at Your Own Risk)

If you have any insights, suggestions for improvement (especially regarding the organizational chaos), or simply want to commiserate about the complexity, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Just be prepared to dive deep!

**Disclaimer:** You have been warned. Proceed with curiosity, a healthy dose of skepticism, and perhaps a strong cup of coffee. You might just discover something amazing... or just get thoroughly confused. Either way, enjoy the journey (or the descent)!
